Currently refactoring this project and porting it to the latest version of dotnet
also removing the junk in it


Next i'll start working with dotnet core and maybe port it to asp.net

TODO:

    Port to dotnet 3.0

    Refactor the project, 
        
    start working on a GUI for it, probably in HTML using ajax, but considering TKINTER or ASP.NET
    
    containerize the project
